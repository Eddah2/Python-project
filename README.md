This dataset includes demographic information such as customer age,gender, and geographical location and various banking-related attributes are captured, including customer account balance, the number
of products held, credit card usage, and transaction histor.

The target variable for developing predictive models to forecast churn probability is a binary churn label,1 indicating whether a customer
has churned/ exited the bank or 0 if not


The following were the steps followed

i) Loading the dataset

ii)Explonatory data analysis

iii)Data preprocessing

iv) Models training and testing

Amongst 9 models which were trained,Cat boost classifier had the highest accuracy(87.37%).Followed closely bt XGBoost
Classifier(87.17%),Gradient boosting Classief(87%),Random Forest(86.93%)

Other models had accuracy around 80%, these models are Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,Artificial Neural Network,KNearest Neighbours and Gaussian Naive Bayes
